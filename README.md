# Dynamik

## Developing

Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

## Deployments

- Vercel: https://dynamik.vercel.app/
- GitHub Pages (slower, no SSR): https://csunibo.github.io/dynamik/

A third deployment is in progress on our own server.
